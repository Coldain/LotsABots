/**
 * Now that you have organized your data in a knowledge graph format, you can use it to provide context-aware responses in your SOMA bot. To leverage the data effectively, you will need to parse the JSON data and search through it based on user queries. Here's an example of how to use the data in a choose-your-own-adventure book persona:

Parse the JSON data: When you receive a query, extract the relevant information from the JSON objects in the Google Sheets. You can use Google Apps Script or another programming language (like Python) to read the data from the Sheets, parse the JSON strings, and convert them into native objects for easier manipulation.

Search the data: Based on the user's query, search for relevant information in the parsed objects. For example, if the user asks about a specific character or event, you can search the "nodes" for matching names or types. Similarly, you can search the "edges" to find relationships between nodes, such as characters attending specific events or owning particular items.

Construct a response: Once you have found the relevant information, you can use it to construct a context-aware response. For example, if the user asks about a character's activities, you can find the attended events and associated items, then describe them in a natural language format.

Update the knowledge graph: As the user interacts with the bot and makes choices, you may need to update the knowledge graph to reflect changes in the story, character relationships, or item ownership. You can do this by modifying the JSON objects and updating the Google Sheets with the new data.

Here's a simple example:

User: "What did John Doe do in his first therapy session?"

Parse the JSON data and find the node with the name "John Doe" and type "Patient".
Look for edges with a "source" equal to John Doe's UUID and a "type" of "attended".
Find the target nodes (e.g., therapy sessions) of those edges and extract the relevant information.
Construct a response: "In John Doe's first therapy session, he performed the plank exercise to help with his lower back pain."
By using the knowledge graph to store and organize the data, you can create a more immersive and context-aware experience for your users. This approach allows you to track various elements of the story, provide personalized responses, and adapt the bot's behavior based on the user's choices and actions.
